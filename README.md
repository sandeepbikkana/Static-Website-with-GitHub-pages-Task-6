# Static-Website-with-GitHub-pages-Task-6
# Static Website on GitHub Pages

This repository hosts a **static website** using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## 📄 What is this?
A simple website built with **HTML** and **CSS**  that is served directly to visitors without any backend processing.

## 🌐 Live Site
[View Website](https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME/)

## 🚀 How it works
- GitHub Pages takes the files from the `main` branch of this repository.
- It serves them exactly as they are — **static hosting**.
- Whenever you **commit and push changes** to `main`, GitHub Pages redeploys the updated files automatically.

## 🛠 How to update the site
1. Edit `index.html`, `styles.css`, or any other files locally.
2. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update site content"
   git push
